# Kaggle Test
A playground repository for learning to use git.

### Instructions:
1. Head over to Kaggle and choose a [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) of you choice to work on.
2. Write code to pre-process the dataset of the chosen competition, and also create a model which trains on the dataset.
3. Upload whatever code you had written into this repository. Make sure you create a folder first (give it your name), place the code files inside your folders.

The purpose is to get a brief idea on using git, about kaggle and also learning to practically implement a ML model. You are free to use any ML algorithms you seem appropriate, including neural networks. You will find several reference materials in kaggle itself as you learn more how to use it.


### Final submission sample overview:
